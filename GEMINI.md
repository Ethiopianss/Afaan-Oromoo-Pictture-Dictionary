## statement of the problem
The Afaan Oromo Picture Dictionary project holds profound importance both as an educational innovation and a cultural preservation tool, while exemplifying key software engineering principles in practice. At its core, it tackles a critical gap in language learning resources for Afaan Oromo, a language spoken by over 40 million people primarily in Ethiopia and neighboring regions. For diaspora communities, where exposure to the language is often limited to family settings, this app provides an accessible, engaging platform that combines visual aids, audio pronunciations, interactive quizzes, and categorized vocabulary to facilitate effective acquisition and retention. By addressing personal challenges like the lack of high-quality, maintained tools, it empowers users to overcome barriers to fluency, fostering stronger cultural connections and identity preservation in an increasingly globalized world.
## specific goals
1. To develop a categorized visual dictionary module that integrates pictures, audio pronunciations, and word definitions for at least 500 initial Afaan Oromo vocabulary entries across categories like animals, food, and everyday objects, enabling effective word association and basic language acquisition. 
2. To implement interactive quizzes and progress tracking features that allow learners to test vocabulary retention through image-based questions, with personalized scoring and tracking of user performance over time to reinforce learning and measure improvement. 
3. To create a community contribution system where registered contributors can upload new words with pictures and audio, expanding the dictionary's content dynamically while ensuring cultural accuracy and relevance for diaspora users.
